# points-stack
A simple Reactjs challenge to put dots on a screen.

After watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BmLYHLPZs felt inspired to give this a crack. For my implementation I used a stack and pointer, this makes for nice clean code. By just using a single array and then chopping off its head to get to currect state we don't have to do anything funky.
